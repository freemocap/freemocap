#About Us

The Free Motion Capture Project (FreeMoCap) aims to provide research-grade markerless motion capture software to everyone for free.

We're building a user-friendly framework that connects an array of `bleeding edge` open-source tools from the computer vision and machine learning communities to accurately record full-body 3D movement of humans, animals, robots, and other objects.

We want to make the newly emerging mind-boggling, future-shaping technologies that drive FreeMoCap's core functionality accessible to communities of people who stand to benefit from them.

We follow a ‚ÄúUniversal Design‚Äù development philosophy, with the goal of creating a system that serves the needs of a professional research scientist while remaining intuitive to a 13-year-old with no technical training and no outside assistance.

A high-quality, minimal-cost motion capture system would be a transformative tool for a wide range of communities - including 3d animators, game designers, athletes, coaches, performers, scientists, engineers, clinicians, and doctors. We hope to create a system that brings new technological capacity to these groups while also building bridges between them.
