## Pardon our dust as we transtion to the `alpha` phase of this project!

We are currently in the process of transitioning from the  `pre-alpha` code base into the fully refactored `alpha` code base. Some things might be a bit clunky while we make the transition, but I promise it will be worth it!

If you would like to access the `pre-alpha` code, you can find it here under the release tag `v0.0.54` [here](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/releases/tag/v0.0.54)

(2022-07-19) [If you are interested in this project, please fill out this quick (<1min) survey to let use know who you are :D ](https://forms.gle/CPnMe3LvrRPn5cis6)

## Pre-requisites

- At least 2 simple webcameras (but we recommend using at least 3 for better results)
    - Any USB webcam should work [here's an example of a camera we have used successfully](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-110-Degree-Widescreen-Streaming-Conferencing/dp/B084ZJFNKN)
- Each Camera must have a clean, unobstructed view of a Charuco board during initialization.
