```
pip install freemocap~=1.0.0rc0
```

2. Launch the GUI by entering the command:
```

4. Have fun! It might break!  Work in Progress lol 

5. [Join the Discord and let us know how it went!](https://discord.gg/nxv5dNTfKT)


## Install/run from source code (i.e. the code in this repo)

> NOTE - these are super bare-bones install instructions just to show the new entry point - these instructions will be overhauled very soon (written 2023-03-14)

Open an [Anaconda-enabled command prompt](https://www.anaconda.org) (or equivalent) and enter the following commands:

1) Create a `Python3.8+` environment 
```bash
conda create -n freemocap-env python=3.9
```

2) Activate that newly created environment
```bash
conda activate freemocap-env
```
3) Clone the repository (pip install coming very soon!)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap
```

4) Navigate into the newly cloned/downloaded `freemocap` folder
```bash
cd freemocap
```

5) Install the package via the `pyproject.toml` file
```bash
pip install -e .
```

6) Launch the GUI (via the `freemocap.__main__.py` entry point)
```bash
python -m freemocap
```

A GUI should pop up! 


## Documentation and Knowledge Base (NOTE - no docs exist for the version of the GUI on the `main` branch yet - these docs refer to the `Alpha` release

Documentation for this software is currently pretty thin... but we're woking on it!

Here's a YouTube video that covers a lot of relevant material (check the `chapters` for specific topics) - https://youtu.be/GxKmyKdnTy0

Our documentation lives here (for now) - https://freemocap.readthedocs.io
