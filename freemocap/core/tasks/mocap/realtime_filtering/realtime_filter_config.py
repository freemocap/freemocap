Tunable configuration for the realtime filtering + skeleton-fitting stage.

Consumed by the realtime aggregator node, which wires these values into:

    - ``RealtimePointGate``       (velocity teleportation rejection)

    Coordinate-space assumptions
    ----------------------------
    Triangulated 3D positions arrive in **millimeters** (the charuco board
    used for calibration is defined with ``square_length_mm``, so the
    calibration extrinsics and all downstream triangulation output are in mm).

    The One Euro filter's adaptive cutoff formula is::

        cutoff(Hz) = min_cutoff + beta * |velocity(mm/s)|

    Because velocity is in mm/s, **beta has units of 1/mm**.  Tuning beta as
    if the data were in meters (i.e. ~0.3) will produce a filter that is
    ~1000x too responsive — passing nearly all noise through at any non-zero
    velocity.  The defaults here assume millimeter-space coordinates.

    # time (seconds) between calls, so behaviour is consistent at 15 fps or 60 fps.
