# How to use the `pre-alpha` code


We're in the process of switching over to the `alpha` phase of this project (`v0.1.0` and on) , which use full refactor code written with help from a professional experienced software architect. 

Until the new code stabilizes, you may have more luck using the `pre-alpha` code (e.g. `v0.0.54`)

---
## INSTALLATION 

Note: This will install the latest/last version from the `pre-alpha` phase of this project, frozen at release tag `v0.0.54` [here](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/releases/tag/v0.0.54)

Open an Anaconda-enabled command prompt or powershell window and enter the following commands:

1) Create a Python3.7 Anaconda environment
```bash 
conda create -n freemocap-env python=3.7
``` 

2) Activate that newly created environment
```bash
conda activate freemocap-env
```
3) Install freemocap (version `0.0.54`)  from PyPi using `pip`
```bash
pip install freemocap==0.0.54
```

BUG FIX - Update `mediapipe` with: `pip install mediapipe --upgrade`

That should be it!

##  How to create a *NEW* `freemocap` recording session

tl;dr- **Activate the freemocap Python environment** and run the following lines of code (either in a script or in a console)

```python
import freemocap
freemocap.RunMe()
```

But COOL KIDS will install Blender ([blender.org](https://blender.org) and generate an awesome `.blend` file animation by setting `useBlender=True`: 

```python
import freemocap
freemocap.RunMe(useBlender=True)
```

:point_right: **For additional, more detailed instructions (including methods to re-process recorded sessions), [refer to the `OLD_README.md` document](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/blob/main/OLD_README.md))** :point_left:

#  HOW TO RUN THE `alpha` GUI

NOTES
- no promises here, friends. Work in progress lol :joy:    
- Personally, I run the gui through PyCharm, but its easier to write instructions on how to run from an anaconda prompt
 
## Pre-requisites:
1. Install Anaconda
    - https://anaconda.org
2. Install git 
     - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git (just use the defaults)  
3. (OPTIONAL) Install Blender - https://blender.org

## Installation instructions

1. Open anaconda enabled terminal

2. Create a `python=3.9` environment
```bash
conda create -n freemocap-gui python=3.9
```

3. Activate that environment:
```
conda activate freemocap-gui
```

4. Clone the repository (i.e. download the code from github. It'll show up in the current working directory of your terminal session)
```
git clone https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap
```

5. Navigate into that newly cloned/downloaded `freemocap` folder with:
```
cd freemocap
```

6. Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
7. Run the GUI by running the `src/gui/main/main.py` file by entering this command into the terminal:

```bash
python src/gui/main/main.py
```

8. Hopefully a GUI popped up! There are no docs on usage yet, so just click and see what you can figure out :joy:

```bash
task setup
```
2. Run the tests to ensure that everything works appropriate
```bash
task test
```

### Contribution Guidelines

Please read our contribution doc: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Creating a new binary (may or may not work lol)

Create a new binary on your local system by running the below comand
```bash
task installer
