# C3D File Export

I am attempting to use the c3d python module to convert the FMC numpy output to a c3d file format. I am glad to be diving into code written by a team of people who likely have more experience than me. I think it should be a good way to learn more about how to effectively code.

So a general structure...there are import statements, constants being set, then the beginning of some class definitions. @property operators are used to define a number of properties...I do find myself wondering the value of doing it this way rather than just defining these things in the init function. I mean, really...

Maybe a good question for r/learnpython.

Helper functions seem to be defined between class functions.

I like the consistency of the function commenting.
