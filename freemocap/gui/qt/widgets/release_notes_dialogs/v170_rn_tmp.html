    âœ¨ New Feature: Ground Plane Calibration
</p>

<p>
    <b>How to use it:</b><br/>
    1. Check the <span class="emphasis">"Use board position as origin"</span> option before calibration<br/>
    2. Start your calibration recording with the board flat on the ground (visible to as many cameras as possible) for a few
    seconds<br/>
    3. Continue calibration as normal - that's it!
    <br/><br/>
    This new feature automatically aligns your 3D Capture Volume to the detected baord position, ensuring:
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <li>The origin is at the charco corner #0</li>
    <li>The X+ axis points along the board's SHORT axis</li>
    <li>The Y+ axis points along the board's LONG axis</li>
    <li>The Z+ axis points UPWARDS normal to the board (XxY)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <br/>
    Previously, the reference frame resulting from our customized [anipose](https://github.com/lambdaloop/aniposelib)
    based calibration method was defined based on the 6DoF position of the first camera,
    and we defined the floor post-hoc in each recording based on detected foot location.
    <br/><br/>
    This process could fail if the feet weren't detected well, resulting the data returning a random-ish orientation.
    (NOTE:
    You can correct this kind of error by adjusting the position of the recording parent Empty in the generated
    `[recording_name].blend` Blender scene).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The new calibration method sets the capture volume orientation at the level of <em>CALIBRATION</em> file, which keeps the reference frame
consistent across recordings.
</p>
<b>Note:</b> If ground plane calibration fails (board not visible or moving), the system automatically falls back
to the standard calibration method.
