mediapipe_confidence_cutoff_tool_tip_str = "Removes `mediapipe 2d` that has a confidence value less than [this_threshold].\n\n Every tracking algorithm will (should!) give you some measure of confidence - For mediapipe, they call it 'visibility' and it is a number between 0 and 1. NOTE - You should never really trust these `confidence` values completely, especially when neural networks (nn's) are involved. NN's are notorious for assigning very high confidence values to completely bonkers wrong answers (see e.g. Nguyen, Yosinski, and Clune (2015) 'Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled').  \n\n In our case, mediapipe will often find ghost skeletons in the background clutter of the scene and assign them high enough confidence that they will pass this threshold, which can wreck the 3d reconstruction. \n\n TO DO- We should really be using a more geometically grouned `reprojection error` based method for filtering.
