                <b>âœ¨ New Feature: Ground Plane Calibration</b><br/>
                Your 3D reconstructions now come in standing upright with feet on the ground - no post-processing rotation needed!
            </div>

            <p>
            We're excited to introduce <b>Ground Plane Calibration</b> - a game-changing feature that ensures your captured data is properly oriented from the start.
            <br/><br/>

            <b>What's the big deal?</b><br/>
            Previously, our 3D world coordinate system was defined by Camera 0's perspective, which often resulted in subjects appearing to lie sideways or at odd angles. You'd have to manually rotate everything in post-processing to get your subjects standing upright.
            <br/><br/>

            Now, by simply placing your ChArUco board flat on the ground at the start of calibration, FreeMoCap automatically:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Sets the origin (0, 0, 0) at the board's corner</li>
                <li>Aligns the Z-axis to point straight up from the floor</li>
                <li>Ensures your subjects stand tall with their feet at Z=0</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            <b>How to use it:</b><br/>
            1. Check the <span class="emphasis">"Use Charuco board as groundplane"</span> option before calibration<br/>
            2. Start your calibration recording with the board flat on the ground (visible to all cameras) for a few seconds<br/>
            3. Continue calibration as normal - that's it!
            <br/><br/>

            The result? Clean, properly oriented 3D data right out of the box. Your skeletons will be standing upright, feet firmly planted at ground level, ready for analysis or animation without any manual rotation needed.
            <br/><br/>

            <b>Pro tip:</b> If ground plane calibration fails (board not visible or moving), the system automatically falls back to the standard calibration method, so you're never stuck.
            <br/><br/>

            <p>So, remember last time when we said we were going to add a <a href="https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/pull/676"> set of comprehensive quality assurance diagnostics </a> to ensure monotonically increasing data quality?
            <br/><br/>

            Well, we did that and immediately discovered a bug in our calibration/reconstruction pipeline that has apparently been causing a ~10-15% scaling offset to our data (i.e. so measured limb segment lengths would be ~85-115% of their real-world lengths)
            <br/><br/>
           Good news is that we fixed it, so our data should be more accurately scaled to real-world units! We call that progress ðŸ˜Œ
            <br/><br/>
            If your application requires empirical accuracy, we recommend reprocessing any critical data with the latest version of FreeMoCap to ensure the highest quality results.
            <br/>
            <br>
            See  <a href="https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/pull/681">Issue #681</a> for a full run down on the code sleuthing and thread pulling that led to this fix.

                Possible data Quality Regression in versions 1.4.7-1.5.3
            </p>

            <p>We identified and fixed a bug in <b>v1.4.7-v1.5.3 (10 Oct 2024 - 10 Mar 2025)</b> that caused the pipeline to Butterworth filtering during processing (<a href="https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/pull/675">Bugfix PR</a>).
            Recordings from these versions may have increased noise/jitter/shakiness in the final keypoint trajectories.
            <br/><br/>
            Based on your application, the difference may or may not be noticeable. It is most likely to affect users who's applications focus on fine grained trajectories of the hands and limbs (especially for scientific analysis)
            <br/><br/>
            <b>We recommend reprocessing any critical data collected during this period with the latest version of FreeMoCap to ensure the highest quality results.</b>
            <br/><br/>
             You may also filter the data in Blender (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33OhM5xFUlg">this tutorial Flux Renders</a>)
